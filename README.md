This tool is meant to eat kills from zkillboard via it's open api.

Pump it into a lcoal Elastic search index.

then visualise the statistics on what people are fitting.

should be able to set time persion.

should be able to do cluster analysis, to for exmaple , distinguish between a PVE and PVP fit.

think about "auto tagging" on rules. ( if scram then pvp )
